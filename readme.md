MyGame

Let me know a title for my game!

This is basically just an overhead 2D adventure game. I'm doing this for learning
purposes to see how larger games are built. I'm doing this without a tutorial,
and am basically winging it, so if you are knowledgeable feel free to drop me some tips!

This is written in C++ with the SFML libraries to aid in graphics.
