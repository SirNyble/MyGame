MyGame

Let me know a title for my game! Still no idea for the title - aBlueSky

This is basically just an overhead 2D adventure game. I'm doing this for learning
purposes to see how larger games are built. I'm doing this without a tutorial,
and am basically winging it, so if you are knowledgeable feel free to drop me some tips!

This is written in C++ with the SFML libraries to aid in graphics.

Contributing:
- git clone https://github.com/SirNyble/MyGame

- If you don't have SFML libraries you must install. If you are running Ubuntu,
use: sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

- cd into the directory and run: make

- to run: ./MyGame
